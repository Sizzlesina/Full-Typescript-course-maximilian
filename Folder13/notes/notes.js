! I cant finish this project properly because the Google geocoding API is need a payment method and i dont have any credit card

@ Using axios to fetch data:
++ npm i --save axios
++ import axios from "axios";

- If you need extra types we must install them
++ We can use the ".get" method from axios to get the data

* Instead we can check on openLayers documentation
